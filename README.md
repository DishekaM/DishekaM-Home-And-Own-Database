# DishekaM-Home-And-Own-Database
 The Home and Own Real Estate database will not only display the available homes for sale and for rent, but it will personalize the agents experience with all the tools they need to personalize the customer/buyers’ experience.

The Home and Own Real Estate database will not only display the available homes for sale and for rent, but it will personalize the agents experience with all the tools they need to personalize the customer/buyers’ experience. We want to make the home listing and removing process easy and efficient for the user.

**(Feature List)** The top 3 features this database will include are:
1. Inserting(listing) a home for sale or for rent
2. Deleting a home off the market
3. Sorting the homes depending on different factors (price)
The homes listed will be randomized for the user to experience a wide range of properties before making necessary filter changes.

**(Action Items)** The action items below are:
* Gather different data about homes for rent/sale for tables
* Price, address, beds, size(in sqft)
* Create a table for the homes that are for sale
* Create a table for the homes that are for rent
* Create SQL Queries for inserting(listing) homes for both rent and for sale tables
* Create SQL Queries for deleting(removing) homes for both rent and for sale tables
* Create SQL Queries for sorting homes for both rent and for sale tables based on Price
* Extra Create UI of Database (If time is available) Assess anything extra that can be added into the database

**(Key Success Factors)** The key success factors that can be used to measure the success of my project are:
* Successful listing and removal of properties
* Successful filtering of listed homes (includes price)
* Successful integration of the front end work (UI) and backend that shows that my front end successfully communicates with the database.
